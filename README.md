The new revolutionary file type - .max. It is portable, cross-platform, executable and 100% available. You can code them using python and then converting the .py files to .max files using the 'Py-Max.max' file converter. If you're opening a .max file for the first time, click 'more apps', scroll down and click 'look for another app on this pc'. Then direct to your 'MaxExecutor.exe' file and click open.
